# Welcome to 100 Days Of Kubernetes!

100 Days of Kubernetes is the challenge in which we aim to learn something new related to Kubernetes each day across 100 Days!!!

> You Can Learn Anything 

A lot of times it is just about finding the right resources and the right learning path. 

## What can you find in this book

This book provides a list of resources from across the cloud native space to learn about and master Kubernetes. Whether you are just getting started with Kubernetes or you are already using Kubernetes, I am sure that you will find a way to use the resources or contribute :)

## Just a note of caution

The notes in this book depend on the community to improve and become accurate. Everything detailed so far is someone's personal understanding at each point in time learning about the respective topics. 

Help us improve the notes. 

## 100 Days Of Kubernetes

So what is this challenge all about? The idea (and credit) goes to two existing communities :
1. [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)
2. [100DaysOfCloud](https://www.100daysofcloud.com/)

The idea is that you publicly commit to learning something new. This way, the community can support and motivate you. Every day that you are doing the challenge, just post a tweet highlighting what you learned with the #100DaysOfKubernetes hashtag. 

Additionally, creating your own content based on what you are learning can be highly valuable to the community. For example, once you wrote a blog post on Kubernetes ReplicaSets or similar, you could add it to this book.  

The goal is to make this a community-driven project.
